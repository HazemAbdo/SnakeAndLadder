#  SnakeAndLadder
A simple game written in c++ using oop principles
## Game-Description

<br/>
a mixture between the Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly games. There are two modes in the game: Design mode is where
the user is able to build the playing grid and Play mode is where he plays the game itself. The general
idea of the game is four players moving in a grid having snakes, ladders, and Cards. The player goal
is to get to the last cell before anyone else. He also takes advantage of the special cells to boost his
game and obstruct his opponents. The game ends when a player reaches the last cell.
